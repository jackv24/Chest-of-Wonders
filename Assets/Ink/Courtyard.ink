@Belle: These creatures came out of nowhere.
@Belle: Wait, maybe they live here, and weâ€™re the intruders? Hehehe are we the bad guys?
@Clover: Hey! Is someone down there?
@Belle: Abso-tiva-lutley! Is someone up there?
@Clover: Umm...let me check. No. I don't think so. Wait, no. There is. Me! 
@Belle: Are you sure?
@Clover: Am I dreaming?
@Clover: ...
@Clover: OWW! Yes I'm sure.
@Belle: Hey you! Can you go see if she needs help? I'll be fine down here.
